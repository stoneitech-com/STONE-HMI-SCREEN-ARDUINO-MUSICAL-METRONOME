# STONE-HMI-SCREEN-ARDUINO-MUSICAL-METRONOME
This paper developed a music metronome based on the Stone-STVC070WT screen. This scheme uses the Stone-STVC070WT HMI screen as the display control platform and the Arduino board as the beat audio output terminal to create a simple and easy-to-use music metronome.
